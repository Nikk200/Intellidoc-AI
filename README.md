# IntelliDoc AI Project

## Overview

The IntelliDoc AI Project is an Intelligent Document Processing System designed to automate the extraction and processing of text from various document types using OCR and AI technologies. It integrates Django for the backend, Python OCR libraries, and AI models for text analysis, with a MySQL/MariaDB database for storing results.

## Features

- **User Management:** Registration, login, and authentication.
- **Document Upload:** Form-based document upload functionality.
- **OCR Integration:** Extraction of text from documents using OCR.
- **AI Processing:** Analysis of extracted text with AI models.
- **Database Integration:** Storage of extracted and processed information in MySQL/MariaDB.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Handling of large documents or heavy AI tasks using Celery.
- **Frontend Implementation:** User interface for document management and processing status.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Django 4.0+**
- **Celery**
- **Redis** (for Celery result backend)
- **MySQL/MariaDB**
- **Python OCR Libraries** (e.g., Tesseract)
- **AI Libraries** (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intellidoc-ai.git
   cd intellidoc-ai
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Configure your MySQL/MariaDB database settings in `settings.py`.
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

5. **Start Redis Server:**
   - Follow Redis installation instructions for your operating system.

6. **Start Celery Worker:**
   ```bash
   celery -A project_name worker --loglevel=info
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

- **Upload Documents:** Navigate to the upload form on the frontend to submit documents.
- **Processing Status:** Check the status of document processing through the user interface.
- **View Results:** Access extracted and AI-processed information via the frontend or database.
